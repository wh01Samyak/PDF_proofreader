# PDR_proofreader
Open source PDF proofreader

## Design and develop image-form PDF and editable form PDF compare tool - 
Conventionally printed materials are digitized for better preservation and logistics. Digital scanners and OCR tools donâ€™t produce exact replica of the book/ content which is to be digitized. Comparing original material with digitized material is voluminous and cumbersome task with uncertainty about accuracy. Now there is plethora of file comparing tools available but none does what is required other than ABBYY Finereader which is propriety software.
The development of an open source alternative for Finereader will facilitate community to compare and correct image form PDF and editable form PDF.

Basic features of the portal are as follows - 
* Compare image form PDF and editable form PDF and highlight the differences between two.
* Facilitate user to correct the errors existing in the editable form document.
